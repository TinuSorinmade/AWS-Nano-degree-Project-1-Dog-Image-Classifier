Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification: Tinu Sorinmade

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:Yes, all three model architectures (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) correctly classified the breed of the dog in Dog_01.jpg (Basenji_01.jpg..jpg) as "basenji". 

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) correctly classified the breed of Dog_01.jpg (Basenji_01.jpg..jpg) and Dog_02.jpg (Basenji_02.jpg) as "basenji".

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg (Fox_Squiral_01.jpg) and Object_Name_01.jpg (Coffee_mug_01.jpg) as not being dogs.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:Since all three architectures (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) correctly classified the breeds and non-dogs in the provided images, all can be considered effective. However, VGG is selected as the best because it performed consistently with the correct classifications in all cases.
